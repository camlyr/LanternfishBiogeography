# Biogeographical regions and climate change: lanternfishes shed light on the role of climatic barriers in the Southern Ocean


This repository contains all the data and code supporting the study. 


## Input data

**Species occurrence**
- *mycto_occ_1deg.csv* --> CSV file containing all occurrence records of the 115 species aggregated on a 1°-grid
